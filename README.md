A simple card game developed in C#.

## Overview
This simple card game called 'Lincoln', which was developed for an assignment on my university's Computer Science course, has a user play against the computer. Here are the rules:
*  Each user is randomly dealt ten cards each
*  Each card has its own value, e.g. 5 of Spades  = 5, King of Hearts = 13, etc.
*  At each round, users choose two cards to play and the combined total value is compared against the other player's total value, e.g. 5 + 13 = 18
*  Whoever has the highest total value wins the round, and chooses their hand first for the next round
*  The user with the most rounds won wins the game!
*  If the game ends in a draw, then each player draws one card from the deck and competes for the highest value until a winner is decided
*  BTW, *the Ace has the highest value, 14!*
